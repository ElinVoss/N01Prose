# Saint Merro — City Geography and Culture

## Overview
Saint Merro is a vertically stratified industrial city built on hillside terracing with extensive underground infrastructure. The Piercing exit-side event occurs directly over/through Saint Merro, making it ground zero for the catastrophe.

## Vertical Geography

### Upslope (Crown District)
- **Location:** Upper terraces and hilltop
- **Population:** Administrative class, guild leadership, merchant elite
- **Architecture:** Stone buildings, cleaned streets, controlled access
- **Priorities:** Order, throughput maintenance, appearance of stability
- **Post-Piercing:** Structural damage but resources for rapid repair

### Midslope (Working Districts)
- **Location:** Middle terraces
- **Population:** Craft workers, guild members, inspectors, analysts
- **Architecture:** Mixed stone/timber, workshop clusters, residential blocks
- **Priorities:** Production, craft standards, guild reputation
- **Post-Piercing:** Mixed damage, competition for repair resources

### Downslope (The Dregs)
- **Location:** Lower terraces and valley floor
- **Population:** Day laborers, unaffiliated workers, marginalized communities
- **Architecture:** Salvaged materials, crowded lanes, unstable structures
- **Priorities:** Survival, mutual aid networks, avoiding authority
- **Post-Piercing:** Catastrophic damage, minimal official response

## Infrastructure Systems

### The Underface
- **Function:** Below-ground heat distribution, water routing, structural support
- **Access:** Inspection shafts, ladder systems, maintenance corridors
- **Grid-Hum:** Baseline vibration from active heat/water flow through pipes
- **Personnel:** Inspectors (like Jhace), maintenance crews, emergency response
- **Post-Piercing:** Wrong grid-hum (altered baseline), increased failure density

### Heat Grid
- **Purpose:** Distribute kiln heat for industrial/residential use
- **Structure:** Junction points, collar connections, branch feeds
- **Risk Points:** Mis-seated collars, stress-cracked pipes, overloaded branches
- **Sectors:** Numbered districts (Sector Fourteen = kiln-quarter feed)
- **Post-Piercing:** Load tolerances invalid, conventional bracing insufficient

### Observatory (Tiffani's Workplace)
- **Location:** Midslope high platform with sightlines
- **Function:** Stellar measurement, trajectory calculation, precision instrumentation
- **Equipment:** Theodolites, glass plates, logbooks, bell warning system
- **Personnel:** Analysts, apprentices (like Pella), instrument craftworkers
- **Post-Piercing:** Destroyed/collapsed, Tiffani salvages logbooks/methods

### Workshop District (Bram's Space)
- **Location:** Midslope near Underface access
- **Function:** Metalwork staging, tool storage, emergency coordination
- **Personnel:** Smiths, inspectors, runners, protocol developers
- **Post-Piercing:** Becomes staging area for Jhace/Tiffani's protocol development

---

## Cultural Elements

### Guild Structure
- **Function:** Regulate craft standards, control access to work, enforce hierarchy
- **Authority:** Foremen, guild masters, administrative council
- **Priorities:** Throughput, reputation, blame avoidance
- **Post-Piercing Behavior:** Resist safety protocols that slow production

### RRO (Repair and Recovery Oversight)
- **Formation:** Post-Piercing administrative body
- **Function:** Coordinate reconstruction, allocate resources, register "special workers"
- **Key Figures:** Corlexi (committee authority), Harlen (field representative)
- **Method:** Registration pressure, resource gatekeeping, co-opt attempts
- **Conflict:** Safety vs throughput, protocol vs bureaucracy

### Salee's Network
- **Function:** Unofficial mutual aid, triage coordination, runner deployment
- **Structure:** Unlabeled operatives, efficient movement, need-first allocation
- **Alignment:** Pragmatic collaboration with Jhace/Tiffani
- **Post-Piercing Role:** Fills gaps official response ignores (especially Dregs)

## Environmental Conditions Post-Piercing

### Persistent Changes
- **Wrong Grid-Hum:** Altered baseline vibration in all infrastructure
- **Copper-Gold Particulate:** Sticky metallic dust coating everything
- **Air Quality:** Smoke, rot, dust mix; never fully clears
- **The Seam:** Visible sky-scar across city sightlines (persistent reminder)
- **Structural Instability:** Load tolerances invalid, aftershocks continue

### Sensory Baseline (Post-Piercing)
- **Taste:** Metallic (copper/iron) coating tongue/molars
- **Sound:** Wrong grid-hum audible in quiet; collapses punctuate distance
- **Skin:** Dust sticks to sweat; tremor becomes common marker
- **Air:** Thick with particulate; breath catches; lungs feel scraped
- **Smell:** Stone dust, smoke, wet rot, metallic edge

## Key Locations (N01 Specific)

### Junction Seven
- **Significance:** Memorial plaque with 23 names (previous failure)
- **Jhace's Ritual:** Reads all names, jaw tight, no outward ceremony
- **Emotional Weight:** Ignored warnings = bodies (Jhace's wound)

### Junction Twelve
- **Risk Point:** Mis-seated collar → Sector Fourteen third branch
- **Chapter 1 Discovery:** Doubled harmonic, tunnel-wide pulse
- **Chapter 3 Crisis:** Emergency Soulpulse stabilization during Piercing
- **Ongoing Threat:** Temporary fixes insufficient for new load patterns

### The Arch (Chapter 6)
- **Location:** Major structural support, high traffic
- **Crisis:** Keystone creep during aftershock, imminent collapse
- **Response:** Jhace's extended Soulpulse hold + Tiffani's release command
- **Outcome:** Temporary stability, Jhace collapse, physical catch moment

### Bram's Workshop
- **Function:** Staging area, protocol development space, training site
- **Equipment:** Practice rig, wedges, cord, chalk, slate walls
- **Social Hub:** Where Jhace, Tiffani, Kylar, Pella, Bram coordinate
- **Protocol Wall:** Where protocol slates are pinned for public viewing

### The Dregs Collapse Zone (Chapter 12)
- **Location:** Downslope, neglected district
- **Crisis Density:** Multiple failures, minimal resources
- **Decision Point:** Crown optics vs Dregs lives (Jhace chooses Dregs)
- **Recognition:** People begin to see Jhace/Tiffani as unit ("chalk and shake")

## Population Dynamics

### Pre-Piercing
- Stratified but stable
- Guild control enforced through access/credentials
- Underface work seen as necessary but low-status
- Observatory work seen as abstract/impractical

### Post-Piercing
- Hierarchy collapses under survival pressure
- Competence becomes currency (guild credentials meaningless)
- Underface inspectors suddenly critical (Jhace gains leverage)
- Analysts become essential (Tiffani's methods prove value)
- Networks form around need, not affiliation

## Saint Merro's Role in N01

**Setting for:**
- Jhace's pre-Piercing inspection routine (Ch1)
- Tiffani's observatory anomaly detection (Ch2)
- Piercing exit-side catastrophe (Ch3)
- Protocol development and testing (Ch4-10)
- Political pressure and resistance (Ch11)
- Public commitment and continued work (Ch12)

**What Saint Merro IS in N01:**
- Broken city requiring constant stabilization
- Vertical inequality made visible through crisis response
- System resisting change despite catastrophic failure
- Home to two craftspeople learning to hold together

**What Saint Merro is NOT in N01:**
- Explained cosmically (no "why here?")
- Restored or resolved (remains unstable)
- Symbol of anything beyond itself (just a city trying to survive)
