# The Piercing — Event Physics and Consequences

## What Happened (Observable Facts)

### The Transit
- Massive object entered Te'Oga on one side of planet
- Object exited near Saint Merro (exit-side location)
- Transit time: seconds to minutes (perceived duration varies by witness)
- Object visible as **spindle**: dark absence with bent-light boundary
- Exit creates **the Seam**: persistent sky-scar visible post-event

### Physical Consequences
- **Gravity Disruption:** Brief reduction (items lift, stomach rises) followed by harsh return (knee-buckling impact)
- **Pressure Wall:** Chest compression felt before audible roar arrives
- **Copper-Gold Particulate:** Metallic dust coating everything, sticks to sweat/surfaces
- **Wrong Grid-Hum:** Infrastructure vibration baseline permanently altered
- **Structural Failure:** Load tolerances invalid, conventional bracing insufficient
- **Aftershocks/Echo Pulses:** Repeating phenomenon, not random settling

## What N01 Does NOT Explain
- Why the Piercing occurred
- What the object was/is
- Where it came from or went
- Why Saint Merro was exit point
- If it will happen again
- Cosmic/divine significance

## Sensory Experience (For Prose)

### Before Impact (Chapters 1-2)
- Doubled harmonic in infrastructure
- Metallic taste without injury source
- Tunnel-wide pulse (not local settling)
- Observatory readings beyond tolerance
- Seven-Three stellar offset (Tiffani's measurement)

### During Impact (Chapter 3)
- Pressure wall hits chest before sound
- Breath interrupts involuntarily
- Gravity reduction: boots lose pressure, stomach lifts
- Harsh return: knees buckle, items crash
- Spindle visible as dark absence through dust
- Bent-light boundary distortion
- Roar arrives after pressure (sound lagging physics)
- Copper-gold grit immediate on all surfaces

### After Impact (Chapters 4-12)
- Wrong grid-hum audible in quiet moments
- Metallic taste becomes baseline (copper on molars)
- Copper-gold particulate visible in all light angles
- The Seam visible in clear sky gaps
- Dust never fully settles
- Air quality permanently degraded (smoke, rot, stone dust mix)

## The Seam (Critical Knowledge Gate)

### What Characters See
- Bent-light scar across sky
- Persistent (doesn't fade)
- Visible from most city locations
- Acts as landmark reference

### What Characters May NOT Do
- Theorize about metaphysical meaning
- Suggest it's watching them
- Treat it as portentous or mystical
- Connect it to anything beyond "sky broke"

### Correct Usage in Prose
> The Seam was visible through the clear gap above the roofline. Both glanced up once. Neither spoke. They returned to the brace work.

## Grid Behavior Changes

### Pre-Piercing Normal
- Predictable vibration patterns
- Load tolerances tested and known
- Settling distinguishable from failure
- Harmonic signatures stable

### Post-Piercing Altered
- Wrong baseline (doubled harmonic persists)
- Load patterns unpredictable
- Echo pulses (system responds to itself)
- Conventional wisdom insufficient

## N01's Relationship to Piercing

**N01 treats Piercing as:**
- Observable catastrophe with physical consequences
- System shock requiring new methods
- Event that revealed Soulpulse manifestation
- Catalyst for Jhace/Tiffani partnership

**N01 does NOT treat Piercing as:**
- Mystical awakening
- Divine judgment or test
- Explainable through lore
- Something with cosmic purpose (from character perspective)
