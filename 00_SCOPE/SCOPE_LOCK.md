# Scope Lock — N01: The Grip That Holds

## What N01 IS
- Ground-level survival story during and after planetary catastrophe
- Partnership formation between two craft specialists under extreme pressure
- Method development: conventional bracing + Soulpulse protocol + cost awareness
- Infrastructure failure and stabilization
- Political resistance to safety protocol
- Public commitment to shared standards despite institutional pressure

## What N01 is NOT
- Cosmic explanation (no "why the Piercing happened")
- God-vessel awareness story (all characters believe they are mortal)
- Origin mythology (no ancient wars, no Counter-Spark revelation)
- Magical training narrative (Soulpulse is tool-like, costly, emergency-only)
- Victory narrative (city remains broken, work continues, no "we won")
- Romance (intimacy exists but is functional, not genre-romance structure)

## Forbidden Reveals (Reserve for Later Novellas)
- God-vessel identities (Jhace = Forge, Tiffani = Glass, Kylar = Cord, others)
- Divine Principles as conscious entities with agency
- Counter-Spark / Auditor existence or orchestration
- Fathom Break mechanics (occurs chronologically after N01)
- Stasis ending and reason for Piercing
- Guilty frame knowledge (all reserved for N30)

## Knowledge Gate: Innocent Frame Rules
Characters in N01 operate under "innocent frame" — they do not know:
- They are god-vessels
- Their abilities derive from Divine Principles
- Anyone is observing/orchestrating events
- The Piercing was intentional or serves a purpose
- The Seam has metaphysical significance beyond visible scar

Characters in N01 DO know/experience:
- Piercing happened (observable catastrophe)
- Soulpulse exists (some people manifest copper-gold glow)
- Costs are real (tremor, vein-lines, exhaustion, sensory overload)
- Infrastructure behaves differently post-Piercing (wrong grid-hum)
- Political institutions prioritize throughput over safety
- Method can be taught and distributed

## N01's Promise to Reader
By end of N01, reader understands:
- How Jhace and Tiffani's partnership formed
- What Soulpulse costs in practical terms
- Why conventional bracing + protocol matters
- That this city will keep demanding choices
- That "holding together" means shared standards under pressure

By end of N01, reader does NOT understand:
- Why the Piercing happened
- What the Seam truly represents
- Who/what Jhace and Tiffani actually are
- Whether anyone is watching/guiding
- What comes next at planetary scale

## Tone Constraints
- Gritty, body-aware, procedural
- No cosmic wonder (awe is earned through craft competence)
- No mysticism (Soulpulse is tool, not spirituality)
- Humor is dry, cutting, rare
- Intimacy is functional (care shown through competence)
- Exhaustion is physical fact, not metaphor

## Structural Constraints
- 12 chapters, 800-1300 words each (HARD LIMIT)
- 25 beats per chapter (no exceptions)
- 5 sensory packets per chapter (mandatory)
- POV: Jhace (1,3,4,6,8,10,12), Tiffani (2,5,7,9,11,12)
- Soulpulse: 7 total uses (Ch3:2, Ch4:2, Ch6:1, Ch8:1, Ch9:1)
- Timeline: Tide 0-3 (approximately 3-4 Tides total span)

## Lexicon Constraints (Non-Negotiable)
- NO metric units (meters, centimeters, kilometers)
- NO imperial units (feet, inches, miles, yards)
- NO Earth time units (minutes, seconds, hours, days, weeks, months, years)
- USE Te'Oga time: Tide, Anneal, Crucible, Casting; Kindling/Pouring/Shaping/Striking/Quench
- USE Te'Oga distance: finger, hand, span, forearm, stride, bar, rod, cable, grid
- NO modern slang or post-1800s idioms
- NO "adrenaline," "endorphins" — use body responses directly

## Character Voice Constraints
**Jhace:** Short sentences. Clipped. Action-first. Procedural internal voice.  
**Tiffani:** Analytical precision. Measurements embedded. Longer sentences with data.  
**Bram:** Dry humor. Cutting brevity. One-liners.  
**Others:** Functional dialogue, minimal exposition.

## Cost Visibility Mandate (Soulpulse)
NEVER: "He felt tired." "She was exhausted." "Pain shot through him."  
ALWAYS: Show tremor, vein-lines, metallic taste, motor failure, vision narrowing, breath disruption.

## Closing Requirement
N01 MUST end with:
- Jhace and Tiffani's explicit partnership commitment
- Protocol embedded in community practice
- Local problem continuing (no cosmic resolution)
- Final line: "They walk back into the Dregs side by side, with method, boundaries, and public defiance intact."
