# N01: THE GRIP THAT HOLDS — Story Bible (Updated Canon)

**Scope lock:** N01 only. No later-book reveals. No meta-layer.  
**Project:** Te'Oga / Saint Merro / Piercing (exit-side catastrophe + aftermath)  
**Format:** 25-beat architecture with micro-sensory packets per chapter

## Folder map
- `00_SCOPE/` — scope constraints, logline, theme, acrostic position
- `01_WORLD/` — Saint Merro city, Underface infrastructure, Piercing physics
- `02_SYSTEMS/` — Soulpulse (N01 rules), cost visibility, craft-as-plot
- `03_CHARACTERS/` — Jhace, Tiffani, supporting cast, relationship progression
- `04_STRUCTURE/` — 12-chapter grid + beat architecture + continuity
- `05_CHAPTER_PACKETS/` — chapter-by-chapter 25-beat scaffolds + sensory packets
- `data/` — machine-readable exports (YAML/JSON)

## How to use
1. Start with `00_SCOPE/SCOPE_LOCK.md` (what you may/should NOT reveal in N01)
2. Read `04_STRUCTURE/CHAPTER_GRID.md` for the narrative spine
3. Read `04_STRUCTURE/BEAT_ARCHITECTURE.md` for the 25-beat system
4. Generate prose chapter-by-chapter using `05_CHAPTER_PACKETS/CH##_*.md` as beat source
5. Reference `03_CHARACTERS/` for voice profiles and relationship progression
6. Enforce lexicon via `02_SYSTEMS/TEOGA_LEXICON.md`

## Canon anchors (non-negotiable in N01)

### Timeline
- **Tide 0:** Chapters 1-3 (pre-Piercing detection → Piercing event → immediate aftermath)
- **Tide 1:** Chapters 4-6 (aftermath stabilization → protocol formation → arch crisis)
- **Tide 2:** Chapters 7-10 (method refinement → Kylar failure → boundary testing → integration)
- **Tide 3:** Chapters 11-12 (political pressure → public commitment)

### Structure
- 12 chapters, 800-1300 words each
- 25 beats per chapter (no exceptions)
- 5 sensory packets per chapter (beats 1-5, 6-10, 11-15, 16-20, 21-25)
- Interludes: 2 (placement TBD by author)
- Epilogue: 1 (Auditor voice, after Ch12)

### Soulpulse Usage
- Total: 7 uses across N01
- Ch3: 2 uses (Chloen rescue + doorway post)
- Ch4: 2 uses (1 fails/no threat, 1 succeeds/justified)
- Ch6: 1 use (arch keystone extended hold)
- Ch8: 1 use (practice rig efficiency test)
- Ch9: 1 use (extended hold approaching Stage 2 boundary)

### The Piercing
- Planetary catastrophe: object transits Te'Oga (entry one side, exit Saint Merro side)
- Visible consequences: gravity disruption, pressure wall, copper-gold particulate, wrong grid-hum
- Spindle: dark absence with bent-light boundary (visible but unexplained)
- The Seam: persistent sky-scar (visible but unexplained)
- Chapter 3 shows full street-level catastrophe (not Underface confined)

### Characters (Named Cast)
- **Jhace Torrins:** Underface inspector/metalworker, POV Chapters 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12
- **Tiffani Merrow:** Observatory glassworker/analyst, POV Chapters 2, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12
- **Bram:** Workshop master, dry humor, protocol enforcer
- **Pella:** Runner, apprentice, names "Don't Die Today" checklist
- **Kylar:** Cord-worker, develops tremor, catastrophic unsupervised failure Ch8
- **Salee:** Network leader, offers collaboration, efficient triage
- **Chloen:** Apprentice, leg crushed in Piercing, rescued by Jhace Ch3
- **Harlen:** RRO representative, delivers summons, apologetic enforcer
- **Corlexi:** Committee authority, presents registration pressure Ch11

### Knowledge Gates (Innocent Frame - N01)
**ALLOWED:**
- Piercing as observable catastrophe
- Soulpulse manifestation + visible costs
- Tremor, vein-lines, metallic taste as cost markers
- The Seam (visible, unexplained)
- Wrong grid-hum (persistent altered baseline)
- Copper-gold particulate (environmental marker)
- RRO formation (political pressure)

**FORBIDDEN:**
- God-vessel identities (all characters unaware of divine status)
- Counter-Spark / Auditor (no orchestrator hints)
- Divine Principles as conscious entities
- Fathom Break (occurs after N01)
- Any "this was planned" implications
- Guilty-frame knowledge (reserved for N30)

### Relationship Progression
- Ch1-2: Separate, pre-Piercing observations
- Ch3: First meeting during catastrophe, parallel movement begins
- Ch4-5: Partnership formation through protocol debate
- Ch6: Physical catch during collapse (first sustained contact)
- Ch7-8: Method refinement, Kylar failure teaches limits
- Ch9: Extended hold + clinical assessment (intimacy through proximity)
- Ch10: Quiet acknowledgment of partnership beyond work
- Ch11: United front against political pressure
- Ch12: Public commitment ("We hold together"), brief intimate touch

### Lexicon (Te'Oga Compliance)
**Time:** Tide, Anneal, Crucible, Casting | Kindling, Pouring, Shaping, Striking, Quench  
**Distance:** Finger, hand, span, forearm, stride, bar, rod, cable, vein-span, circuit, grid  
**NO:** meters, feet, miles, minutes, seconds, hours, days, weeks, months, years  
**Required vocabulary:** Grid-hum, copper-gold particulate, Soulpulse, tremor, vein-lines, Underface, junction, collar, brace, wedge

### Closing Commitment
- Final chapter ends: "They walk back into the Dregs side by side, with method, boundaries, and public defiance intact."
- Commitment line: "We hold together." (No flourish, just function and truth)
- Local problem continues (city still unstable, work remains)
- No cosmic resolution (ground-level survival story)
