- Copy functions (beats 1-5, 6-10, etc. with sensory packets)
- Voice Mode overlays (Jhace, Tiffani, Bram voice profiles)
- Te'Oga compliance reminders (time units, distance units, cost visibility)

**Use for:** Interactive beat reference during prose generation

### 2. Comprehensive Prose Generation Prompt
**File:** `N01-Prose-Generation-Prompt-COMPLETE.md`

**Contains:**
- Complete role & mission statement
- All critical constraints (non-negotiable)
- Te'Oga lexicon (time, distance, forbidden/required terms)
- Cost visibility protocol
- Character voice profiles with examples
- Beat expansion methodology (40-60 words per beat)
- Chapter-by-chapter requirements (all 12 detailed)
- Soulpulse activation protocols (exact beat numbers, contact, intent, visual, duration, cost)
- Sensory packet integration instructions
- Production workflow (8-step process)
- Worked example (Chapter 1, Beats 1-3 expanded)

**Use for:** AI-driven prose generation with full constraint enforcement

## Chapter Beat Examples (Detailed)

### Chapter 1: Something Wrong (Jhace POV)
**Beats 1-25:**
1. Junction Seven plaque: Jhace reads all names in order; jaw tight; no outward ritual.
2. He checks his inspector kit by touch: slate, chalk, cord, collar keys, wedge slips, lamp oil.
3. He logs the time marker as 'Tide 0, Kindling' and writes 'start of route.'
[... 22 more beats]
25. Closing: he walks deeper at controlled pace; doubled harmonic strengthens; dust pulse repeats.

**Sensory Packets (5):**
- Beats 1-5: Neutral taste → copper arrives; baseline grid-hum; metal chill; still damp air
- Beats 6-10: Copper coating molars; doubled harmonic in teeth; dust taps forearms; pressure shifts
[... 3 more packets]

**Full details in:** Prose Generation Prompt, Chapter 1 section

### Chapter 3: The Piercing (Jhace POV)
**Critical Beats:**
- Beat 12: **Soulpulse Use #1** (Chloen rescue, timber beam hold, copper-gold glow threads into grain, tremor begins after release)
- Beat 19: **Soulpulse Use #2** (doorway post stabilization, glow threads stone/lintel interface, cost escalates)

**Sensory Packets:**
- Beats 11-15: Copper/iron intensify at activation; timber creaks; Soulpulse heat under palms; immediate tremor; dust shakes loose

**Full details in:** Prose Generation Prompt, Chapter 3 section

## Sensory Packet System

**Structure:** Every chapter divided into 5 beat clusters (1-5, 6-10, 11-15, 16-20, 21-25)

**Each packet provides:**
- **Taste:** Copper/iron progression, particulate coating, dry mouth
- **Sound:** Grid-hum, crowd noise, tool sounds, structural groans
- **Skin:** Tremor, dust sticking, temperature, pressure, grip
- **Air:** Dust density, smoke/rot, pressure shifts, breath quality

**Usage:** Weave sensory details into prose naturally during each 5-beat cluster

**Example (Ch3, Beats 11-15):**
> Jhace planted both palms under the beam. Metallic taste flooded his mouth—copper coating back molars, then iron joining when he clenched too hard. The timber groaned above. He held contact. Intent narrowed to "hold long enough." Copper-gold glow threaded into grain, following stress lines he couldn't see but felt through his palms. Heat built under his hands—not burning, but present. The crowd noise fractured into individual screams. Then the settling sound changed. The beam stopped creeping. Dust shook loose from roof seams all at once, and his first breath after caught grit halfway down. His lungs felt scraped.

## Cost Visibility Examples

### Tremor Progression Across N01
- **Ch3 (first activation):** "Tremor began in fingers immediately after release."
- **Ch4 (at rest):** "Jhace woke with tremor at rest; tried to steady hands by pressing palms to table; tremor persisted."
- **Ch6 (spread):** "Tremor spreads into shoulders; vein-lines visible; exhaustion slams motor control."
- **Ch8 (endless feel):** "Tremor feels endless; fatigue sits in shoulders; eyes burn from dust."
- **Ch12 (managed not cured):** "Tremor still present in Jhace, managed not cured."

### Metallic Taste Progression
- **Ch1:** "Copper taste on tongue; checks gums for blood; none."
- **Ch3:** "Copper and iron intensify at first contact hold; saliva thick."
- **Ch6:** "Iron after release; nausea edge from exhaustion."
- **Ch9:** "Iron after release; blood taste if gums split; swallowing rough."
- **Ch12:** "Metallic baseline persists into final commitment; becomes part of world's new normal."

## Voice Profile Quick Reference

### Jhace
**Rhythm:** Short. Clipped. Action-first. Thoughts interrupt.  
**Example:** "Jhace pressed palm to pipe. Cold. Rough. Wrong hum underneath. He counted breaths. Dust fell. Fell again. He wrote: repeat interval."

### Tiffani
**Rhythm:** Analytical precision. Measurements embedded. Longer sentences.  
**Example:** "Tiffani marked the stress line in chalk and numbered it: three. Load distribution favored the eastern post by a finger width—enough to matter in a prolonged hold. She wrote the variance and did not allow herself to consider what prolonged meant."

### Bram
**Rhythm:** Dry humor. Cutting brevity. One-liners.  
**Example:** "Bram looked at the practice rig and muttered, 'Romance by wedge.' Neither responded. He grinned and kept working."

## Production Workflow Reference

**For prose generation:**
1. Load chapter beat scaffold (25 beats)
2. Load chapter sensory packets (5 packets)
3. Apply character voice profile (Jhace or Tiffani)
4. Expand beats sequentially (40-60 words per beat)
5. Weave sensory packets into each 5-beat cluster
6. Check Soulpulse cost visibility (show, don't tell)
7. Verify lexicon compliance (no metric/Earth time)
8. Verify word count (800-1300, target 1000-1200)
9. Verify closing beat lands as written
