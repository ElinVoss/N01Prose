# N01 Artifacts Manifest — Complete Beat Architecture

## Critical Production Files (External to This Bible)

The following files contain the COMPLETE 25-beat architecture with all sensory packets and must be used alongside this Bible for prose generation:

---

### 1. N01-Drafting-Console.jsx
**Type:** Interactive React Artifact  
**Size:** ~82,000 words of structured data  
**Contents:**
- All 12 chapters with complete 25-beat scaffolds (300 total beats)
- All 60 micro-sensory packets (taste/sound/skin/air for each 5-beat cluster)
- Search functionality across all beats and sensory data
- Filters: POV, Beat Type, Soulpulse activations only
- Copy functions: Individual beats, beat ranges (1-5, 6-10, etc.), full chapters
- Voice Mode overlays: Jhace/Tiffani/Bram sentence rhythm reminders
- Te'Oga compliance footer: Time units, distance units, cost visibility rules

**Use Case:** Primary reference during prose drafting  
**How to Access:** Open in React-enabled environment or browser with JSX support

---

### 2. N01-Prose-Generation-Prompt-COMPLETE.md
**Type:** Comprehensive GPT Instruction Document  
**Size:** ~35,000 words  
**Contents:**
- Role & mission statement for prose generation engine
- ALL critical constraints (word count, lexicon, cost visibility, voice, knowledge gates)
- Complete Te'Oga lexicon with forbidden/required terms
- Character voice profiles with prose examples
- Beat expansion methodology (beat → 40-60 words prose)
- Chapter-by-chapter detailed requirements (all 12 chapters)
  - Target word counts
  - Soulpulse usage details (exact beats, contact, intent, visual, duration, cost)
  - Key sensory focuses (all 5 packets listed per chapter)
  - Voice reminders specific to each chapter
  - Closing beat requirements (must land as written)
- Dialogue rules and formatting
- Production workflow (8-step process)
- Worked example: Chapter 1, Beats 1-3 fully expanded with checklist

**Use Case:** AI-driven prose generation with full constraint enforcement  
**How to Access:** Upload to Custom GPT or paste into Claude Project

## What This Bible Contains

**This Bible provides:**
- Scope lock and knowledge gates (what N01 may/must not reveal)
- World-building (Saint Merro, Underface, Piercing physics)
- System rules (Soulpulse, lexicon, cost visibility)
- Character profiles (Jhace, Tiffani, supporting cast)
- Chapter grid (high-level objectives and progression)
- Acrostic position (N01's role in GLASS-CRACK-FORGE-SMELT-CLEAR-BREAK)

**This Bible does NOT contain:**
- Complete 25-beat scaffolds (see Drafting Console)
- Complete sensory packets (see Drafting Console)
- Prose expansion methodology (see Prose Generation Prompt)
- Character voice examples (see Prose Generation Prompt)
- Worked prose samples (see Prose Generation Prompt)

## Recommended Workflow

### For Human Prose Writers:
1. Read this Bible (scope, world, systems, characters)
2. Open N01-Drafting-Console.jsx in browser
3. Expand target chapter
4. Reference beat scaffold while writing
5. Pull sensory packet details for each 5-beat cluster
6. Check voice profile overlay if needed
7. Verify lexicon compliance using footer reminders

### For AI Prose Generation:
1. Load N01-Prose-Generation-Prompt-COMPLETE.md into AI system
2. Reference this Bible for world/character/scope context
3. Generate prose chapter-by-chapter using prompt's detailed instructions
4. Each chapter receives complete beat scaffold + sensory packets from prompt
5. AI applies constraints automatically (lexicon, cost visibility, voice, word count)
6. Human reviews output for canon compliance

### For Bible Reference:
1. This Bible = canonical rules and context
2. Drafting Console = granular beat execution
3. Prose Prompt = production methodology

## Why Three Documents?

**This Bible (N01_GripThatHolds_InnocentBible.zip):**
- Canon rules (immutable)
- Scope constraints (what's allowed/forbidden)
- World/system mechanics
- Character profiles
- High-level structure
→ **What the story IS**

**Drafting Console (N01-Drafting-Console.jsx):**
- Granular beat scaffolds
- Sensory packet library
- Interactive exploration
- Copy/paste for drafting
→ **How to BUILD the story**

**Prose Prompt (N01-Prose-Generation-Prompt-COMPLETE.md):**
- AI instruction manual
- Constraint enforcement
- Expansion methodology
- Worked examples
→ **How to GENERATE the story**

## Critical Reminder

**The 25-beat architecture with 60 sensory packets is NOT duplicated in this Bible.**

You must use:
- This Bible (canon rules)
- PLUS Drafting Console OR Prose Prompt (complete beats)
- Together = full production system

Do not attempt prose generation from this Bible alone.
