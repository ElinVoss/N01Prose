# Chapter Grid — N01: The Grip That Holds

## 12-Chapter Overview

| Ch | Title | POV | Tide/Phase | Soulpulse | Beat Type | Key Events |
|---:|---|---|---|:---:|---|---|
| 1 | Something Wrong | Jhace | Tide 0, Kindling | 0 | Observation | Junction Seven ritual → doubled harmonic → worker confrontation → tunnel-wide pulse → deeper first |
| 2 | Glass That Listens | Tiffani | Tide 0, Pouring | 0 | Observation | Observatory setup → Seven-Three offset → copper-gold discovery → Piercing approach witnessed → descent decision |
| 3 | The Piercing | Jhace | Tide 0, Shaping/Striking | 2 | Crisis | Street emergence → catastrophe → Chloen rescue → doorway stabilization → Tiffani arrives → pace sync begins |
| 4 | After the Shudder | Jhace | Tide 1, Kindling | 2 | Trial/Failure | Tremor at rest → failed activation → justified hold → Kylar appears → protocol begins |
| 5 | Where to Press | Tiffani | Tide 1, Pouring | 0 | Training/Method | Cost curve projection → protocol debate → "Don't Die Today" → method proof → arch warning |
| 6 | The Arch Under Strain | Jhace | Tide 1, Shaping/Striking | 1 | Crisis | Chalk boundaries → extended hold → Tiffani's release command → collapse → physical catch → trust fact |
| 7 | Method | Tiffani | Tide 1, Quench | 0 | Recalibration | Practice rig → tremor baseline → Kylar watches → debate escalates → RRO slate → protocol pinned |
| 8 | What Breaks When You Push | Jhace | Tide 2, Kindling | 1 | Trial/Failure | Kylar unsupervised → structure breaks → seizure → triage → protocol revision → efficiency test |
| 9 | Asking | Tiffani | Tide 2, Pouring | 1 | Crisis/Synthesis | Kylar recovery → extended hold → boundary symptoms → clinical assessment → RRO summons → Salee alignment |
| 10 | Integration | Jhace | Tide 2, Shaping | 0 | Recovery/Intimacy | Controlled site → no activation proof → Salee collaboration → quiet moments → finger brush → rest protocol |
| 11 | The Committee Requires | Tiffani | Tide 3, Kindling | 0 | Political Pressure | Summons → Jhace: "No" → cost logic translation → walkout → made choice → Downslope |
| 12 | We Hold | Jhace/Tiffani | Tide 3, Shaping | 0 | Recovery/Intimacy | Dregs choice → craft on page → partnership acknowledgment → touch moment → "We hold together" |

## Beat Architecture Reference

**Every chapter contains:**
- 25 beats (sequential narrative progression)
- 5 sensory packets (beats 1-5, 6-10, 11-15, 16-20, 21-25)
- Target word count: 800-1300 words (1000-1200 optimal)

**Full beat scaffolds available in:**
- `05_CHAPTER_PACKETS/CH##_[Title].md` (individual chapter files)
- `N01-Drafting-Console.jsx` (interactive artifact with all beats + sensory packets)
- `N01-Prose-Generation-Prompt-COMPLETE.md` (comprehensive GPT prompt with all beats detailed)

## Relationship Progression Arc

**Ch1-2:** Separate, pre-Piercing, misjudging each other through guild gossip  
**Ch3:** First meeting during catastrophe, parallel movement begins  
**Ch4-5:** Partnership formation through protocol debate, friction → method  
**Ch6:** Physical catch during collapse (first sustained contact)  
**Ch7-8:** Method refinement, Kylar failure teaches limits  
**Ch9:** Extended hold pushes boundary, clinical touch carries intimacy  
**Ch10:** Quiet acknowledgment of partnership beyond work  
**Ch11:** United front against political pressure  
**Ch12:** Public commitment ("We hold together"), brief intimate touch  

## Soulpulse Progression

- **Ch3, Beat 12:** Use #1 (Chloen rescue, timber beam hold)
- **Ch3, Beat 19:** Use #2 (doorway post stabilization)
- **Ch4, Beat 7:** Use #3 FAILS (no imminent threat, forced testing)
- **Ch4, Beat 15:** Use #4 (justified, Tiffani authorized)
- **Ch6, Beat 13:** Use #5 (arch keystone, extended hold)
- **Ch8, Beat 20:** Use #6 (practice rig efficiency test)
- **Ch9, Beat 14:** Use #7 (extended hold, boundary symptoms)

**Cost escalation:** Tremor begins → spreads → persists at rest → amplifies → approaches Stage 2 boundary

## Continuity Markers

**Must appear consistently:**
- Wrong grid-hum (post-Piercing persistent)
- Copper-gold particulate (visible, sticky)
- Metallic taste (copper → iron progression)
- Tremor progression (fingers → wrists → forearms → shoulders)
- The Seam (visible but unexplained)
- Dust glitter in light angles
- Smoke/rot/stone mix in air

## Voice Profiles

**Jhace (1,3,4,6,8,10,12):**
- Short sentences. Clipped. Action-first.
- Procedural internal voice
- Body awareness constant
- Humor: bitter, dry, rare

**Tiffani (2,5,7,9,11,12):**
- Analytical precision
- Measurements embedded naturally
- Longer sentences with data
- Humor: internal wry observations, never spoken

## Closing Requirements

**Final chapter must include:**
- Jhace chooses Dregs over Crown optics (immediate decision)
- On-page craft (chalk lines, wedge tapping, cord tension, brace placement)
- Partnership acknowledgment (plain, no vow performance)
- Boundaries as protocol (rest, food, stop commands)
- Touch beat (dust cleared from mouth corner, withdrawal, heat lingers)
- The Seam visible in clear gap (looked at once, unexplained)
- Recognition as unit ("requests come to both")
- Commitment line: "We hold together"
- Final line: "They walk back into the Dregs side by side, with method, boundaries, and public defiance intact."
