# Tiffani Merrow — Character Profile

## Role
Observatory analyst, glassworker, precision measurement specialist

## Competencies
- Stellar trajectory calculation
- Stress line prediction
- Modeling panic into variables
- Protocol development
- Glass craft (anneal discipline, fracture prediction, clarity as truth)

## Wound
Dismissed until it's too late

## Need
Insist publicly without becoming a tyrant

## Lie (N01)
"Data only matters if someone powerful approves it."

- **Internal voice:** Self-monitoring, control-focused, grief avoided through measurement
- **Humor:** Internal wry observations. Never spoken aloud.

## Craft Expertise
- Theodolite operation, glass plate calibration
- Logbook notation systems, baseline tracking
- Load path prediction, stress line mapping
- Protocol design (conventional brace + timer + spotter + release authority)

## Cost Progression (N01)
- Ch5: Micro-tremor from exhaustion, logs without drama
- Ch9: Exhaustion shows as hand stiffness
- Ch12: Fatigue accepted as managed variable
