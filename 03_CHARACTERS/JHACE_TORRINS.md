# Jhace Torrins — Character Profile

## Role
Underface inspector, metalworker, load-reader

## Competencies
- Vibration literacy (reads grid-hum, detects harmonics)
- Joint integrity assessment (torque, seating, stress lines)
- Pattern recognition under noise
- Emergency stabilization (conventional bracing)
- Soulpulse manifestation (post-Piercing, costly)

## Wound
Ignored warnings = bodies. Junction Seven memorial: 23 names he reads every time.

## Need
Share responsibility without lowering standards

## Lie (N01)
"If I'm not perfect, people die—so I must control everything."

## Voice Profile
- **Rhythm:** Short sentences. Clipped. Action-first. Thoughts interrupt mid-task.
- **Syntax:** Subject-verb-object. Minimal subordinate clauses. Fragment thoughts acceptable.
- **Internal voice:** Procedural, self-critical, hyper-aware of body/tremor
- **Humor:** Bitter, dry, self-deprecating. Rare but cutting.

## Craft Expertise
- Torque reading, collar seating, load path assessment
- Wedge placement, brace stabilization, cord tension
- Junction maintenance, pipe harmonics, foundation pressure
- Custom tool creation (self-built kiln, mirror-bright steel table)

## Cost Progression (N01)
- Ch3: Tremor begins in fingers after first Soulpulse
- Ch4: Tremor at rest, spreads to wrists
- Ch6: Tremor into shoulders, vein-lines visible
- Ch8: Tremor feels endless, motor control unreliable
- Ch12: Tremor managed but not cured, permanent baseline

## POV Chapters
1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 (alternates with Tiffani in 12)
